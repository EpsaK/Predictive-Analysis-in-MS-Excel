This Github repository describes the build of regression model in Microsoft Excel to predict the value of restaurant tips and its error percentage.

Description: The dataset in file Restaurant Tips Project dataset.xlsx contains tips data for different customers. The following are the features in the dataset:

Gender - gender of the customer |  Smoker- indicates if the customer is a smoker or not | Day- day of the restaurant visit | Time- indicate whether the tip was for lunch or dinner |Size- number of members dining |Total Bill amount- bill amount in USD | Tip- tip amount in USD

The following project tasks were performed in excel: Used the Restaurant Tips Project sheet for the analytics using Excel and found out if there are any missing values and clean the data. Encoded the categorical variables to numeric values using IF conditions.  Found the features that are independent and dependent. Identified which predictive problem is needed and build an appropriate model with the dataset.
Calculated the predicted and actual tips values.  Calculated the RMSE(Root Mean Square Error) of the model. RMSE is the root of the mean of square errors.
